    "4.5 为什么使用深层表示\n",
    "\n",
    "我们都知道深度神经网络(字幕来源：网易云课堂)\n",
    "we've all been hearing that deep neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "能解决好多问题\n",
    "work really well for a lot of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "其实并不需要很大的神经网络\n",
    "it's not just that they need to be big neural networks is that\n",
    "\n",
    "但是得有深度\n",
    "specifically they need to be deep\n",
    "\n",
    "得有比较多的隐藏层\n",
    "or to have a lot of hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "这是为啥呢\n",
    "so why is that\n",
    "\n",
    "我们一起来看几个例子来帮助理解\n",
    "let's go to a couple examples and try to gain some intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "为什么深度神经网络会很好用\n",
    "for why deep networks might work well\n",
    "\n",
    "首先 深度网络究竟在计算什么\n",
    "so first what is there deep network computing\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你在建一个人脸识别 或是人脸检测系统\n",
    "if you're building a system for face recognition or face detection\n",
    "\n",
    "深度神经网络所做的事就是\n",
    "here's what the deep neural network could be doing\n",
    "\n",
    "当你输入一张脸部的照片\n",
    "perhaps you input a picture of a face\n",
    "\n",
    "然后你可以把深度神经网络的第一层\n",
    "then the first layer of the neural network you can think of\n",
    "\n",
    "当成一个特征探测器 或者边缘探测器\n",
    "as maybe being a feature detector or an edge detector\n",
    "\n",
    "在这个例子里 我会建一个\n",
    "in this example I'm plotting what a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "大概有20个隐藏单元的深度神经网络\n",
    "with maybe twenty hidden units\n",
    "\n",
    "是怎么针对这张图计算的\n",
    "might be trying to compute on this image with the twenty hidden units\n",
    "\n",
    "隐藏单元就是这些图里这些小方块\n",
    "visualized by these little square boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "举个例子 这个小方块就是一个隐藏单元\n",
    "so for example this little visualization represents a hidden unit\n",
    "\n",
    "它会去找这张照片里\n",
    "that's trying to figure out if you know\n",
    "\n",
    "边缘的方向\n",
    "where the edges of that orientation are in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "那么这个隐藏单元\n",
    "and maybe this hidden unit\n",
    "\n",
    "可能是在找水平向的\n",
    "might be trying to figure out\n",
    "\n",
    "边缘在哪里\n",
    "where are the horizontal edges in this image\n",
    "\n",
    "之后的课程里\n",
    "and when we talk about convolutional networks\n",
    "\n",
    "我们会讲专门做这种识别的卷积神经网络\n",
    "in a later course of this particular visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "到时候会细讲 为什么小单元是这么表示的\n",
    "we'll make a bit more sense\n",
    "\n",
    "你可以先把神经网络的第一层\n",
    "but informally you can think of the first layer in neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "当作看图 然后去找\n",
    "as look on a picture and trying to figure out\n",
    "\n",
    "这张照片的各个边缘\n",
    "you know where the edges in this picture\n",
    "\n",
    "我们可以把照片里组成边缘的\n",
    "now let's figured out where the edges in this picture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "像素们放在一起看\n",
    "by grouping together pixels to form edges\n",
    "\n",
    "然后它可以把被探测到的边缘\n",
    "it can then take the detected edges\n",
    "\n",
    "组合成面部的不同部分\n",
    "and group edges together to form parts of faces\n",
    "\n",
    "比如说 可能有一个神经元\n",
    "so for example you might have a little neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "会去找眼睛的部分\n",
    "try to see it is finding an eye\n",
    "\n",
    "另外还有别的在找鼻子的部分\n",
    "or a different neuron trying to find that part of the nose\n",
    "\n",
    "然后把这许多的边缘结合在一起\n",
    "and so by putting together lots of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "就可以开始检测人脸的不同部分\n",
    "it can start to detect different parts of faces\n",
    "\n",
    "最后再把这些部分放在一起\n",
    "and finally by putting together on different parts of faces\n",
    "\n",
    "比如鼻子眼睛下巴\n",
    "like a nose or an eye an ear or chin\n",
    "\n",
    "就可以识别或是探测不同的人脸啦\n",
    "it can then try to recognize or detect different types of faces\n",
    "\n",
    "你可以直觉上把这种神经网络的前几层\n",
    "so intuitively you can think of the earlier layers of the neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "当做探测简单的函数 比如边缘\n",
    "is detecting simpler functions like edges\n",
    "\n",
    "之后把它们跟后几层结合在一起\n",
    "and then composing them together in the later layers of a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "那么总体上就能学习更多复杂的函数\n",
    "so that they can learn one more complex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "这些图的意义\n",
    "these visualizations will make more sense\n",
    "\n",
    "我们在学习卷积神经网络的时候再深入了解\n",
    "when we talk about convolutional nets\n",
    "\n",
    "还有一个技术性的细节需要理解的是\n",
    "and one technical detail of this visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "边缘探测器其实相对来说都是针对照片中非常小块的面积\n",
    "the edge detectors are looking in relatively small areas of an image\n",
    "\n",
    "就像这块 都是很小的区域\n",
    "may be very small regions like that\n",
    "\n",
    "面部探测器呢\n",
    "and then the facial detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "就会针对于大一些的区域\n",
    "you can look at may be much larger areas in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "但是主要的概念是\n",
    "but the main intuition when you take away\n",
    "\n",
    "一般你会从比较小的细节入手 比如边缘\n",
    "from this is just finding simple things like edges\n",
    "\n",
    "然后再一步步到更大更复杂的区域\n",
    "and then building them up composing them together\n",
    "\n",
    "比如一只眼睛或是一个鼻子\n",
    "to detect more complex things like an eye or a nose\n",
    "\n",
    "再把眼睛鼻子装一块 组成更复杂的部分\n",
    "and the composing those together to find even more complex things\n",
    "\n",
    "这种从简单到复杂的金字塔状表示方法\n",
    "and this type of simple to complex hierarchical representation\n",
    "\n",
    "或者组成方法\n",
    "or compositional representation\n",
    "\n",
    "也可以应用在图像或者人脸识别以外的其他数据上\n",
    "applies in other types of data than images and face recognition as well\n",
    "\n",
    "比如当你想要建一个语音识别系统的时候\n",
    "for example if you're trying to build a speech recognition system\n",
    "\n",
    "需要解决的就是如何可视化语音 比如你输入一个音频片段\n",
    "is how to visualize speech but if you the input an audio clip\n",
    "\n",
    "那么神经网络的第一层可能就会去先开始试着探测\n",
    "then maybe the first level of a neural network might learn to detect\n",
    "\n",
    "比较低层次的音频波形的一些特征\n",
    "you know low level audio waveform features\n",
    "\n",
    "比如音调是变高了还是低了\n",
    "such as is this tone going up this is going down\n",
    "\n",
    "分辨白噪音啦 咝咝咝的声音啦\n",
    "is it a white noise or sibilant sound lights right\n",
    "\n",
    "或者音调啦\n",
    "and what is the pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "可以选择这些相对程度比较低的波形特征\n",
    "but you can detect take low level waveform features like that\n",
    "\n",
    "然后把这些波形组合在一起\n",
    "and then by composing low level waveforms\n",
    "\n",
    "就能去探测声音的基本单元\n",
    "maybe your learn to detect basic units of sound\n",
    "\n",
    "在语言学中有个概念叫做音位\n",
    "so in linguistics they called phonemes\n",
    "\n",
    "比如说单词cat c的发音 嗑 就是一个音位\n",
    "but for example in the word cat the cup is a phoneme\n",
    "\n",
    "a的发音是个音位 t的发音 特 也是个音位\n",
    "the up ciseaux means that tub is another phoneme\n",
    "\n",
    "有了基本的声音单元以后\n",
    "but learns to find with the basic units of sound and\n",
    "\n",
    "组合起来\n",
    "then composing that together\n",
    "\n",
    "你就能识别音频当中的单词\n",
    "maybe you're going to recognize words in the audio\n",
    "\n",
    "单词再组合起来就能识别词组\n",
    "and then you can compose those together in order to\n",
    "\n",
    "再到完整的句子\n",
    "recognize the entire you know phrases or sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "所以深度神经网络的这许多隐层中\n",
    "so deep neural network with multiple hidden layers might be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "较早的前几层能学习一些低层次的简单特征\n",
    "have the earlier layers learn these low levels simpler features\n",
    "\n",
    "等到后几层\n",
    "and then have the later deeper layers\n",
    "\n",
    "就能把简单的特征结合起来\n",
    "then put together the simpler things that's detected\n",
    "\n",
    "去探测更加复杂的东西\n",
    "in order to detect more complex things\n",
    "\n",
    "比如你录在音频里的单词 词组\n",
    "like recognize specific words or even phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "或是句子 然后就能\n",
    "or sentences that you're uttering\n",
    "\n",
    "运行语音识别了\n",
    "in order to carry out speech recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "同时我们所计算的之前的几层\n",
    "and what we see is that whereas the earlier layers are computing\n",
    "\n",
    "也就是相对简单的输入函数\n",
    "what seems like relatively simple functions of the input\n",
    "\n",
    "比如图像单元的边缘啥的\n",
    "such as where are the edges\n",
    "\n",
    "到网络中的深层时 你实际上就能做\n",
    "by the time you get deep in the network you can actually do\n",
    "\n",
    "很多复杂的事\n",
    "you know surprisingly complex things\n",
    "\n",
    "比如探测面部 或是探测单词 短语 或是句子\n",
    "such as detect faces or detect words or phrases or sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "有些人喜欢把深度神经网络\n",
    "some people like to make an analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "和人类大脑做类比\n",
    "between deep neural networks and the human brain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "这些神经科学家觉得人的大脑\n",
    "where we believe um neuroscientists believe that\n",
    "\n",
    "也是先探测简单的东西\n",
    "the human brain also starts off detecting simple things\n",
    "\n",
    "比如你眼睛看得到的边缘\n",
    "like edges in what your eye see\n",
    "\n",
    "然后组合起来才能探测复杂的物体\n",
    "and it builds those up to detect more complex things\n",
    "\n",
    "比如脸\n",
    "like the faces that you see\n",
    "\n",
    "这种深度学习\n",
    "I think analogies between deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "很人类大脑的比较 有时候比较危险\n",
    "and the human brain are sometimes a little bit dangerous\n",
    "\n",
    "但是不可否认的是\n",
    "but you know there is a lot of truth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "我们对大脑运作机制的认识很有价值\n",
    "to this being how we think the human brain works\n",
    "\n",
    "有可能大脑就是先从简单的东西\n",
    "and that the human brain probably\n",
    "\n",
    "比如边缘着手\n",
    "detects simple things like edges first\n",
    "\n",
    "再组合成一个完整的复杂物体\n",
    "and then puts them together to form more and more complex objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "这类简单到复杂的过程\n",
    "and so that has served as a loose form\n",
    "\n",
    "同样也是其他一些深度学习的灵感来源\n",
    "of inspiration for some deep learning as well\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "之后的视频我们也会继续\n",
    "we'll say a bit more about the human brain\n",
    "\n",
    "聊聊人类或是生物学理解的大脑\n",
    "or about the biological brain in the later video this week\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "另外一个\n",
    "the other piece of intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "关于神经网络为何有效的理论\n",
    "about why neural network seem to work well is the following\n",
    "\n",
    "来源于电路理论\n",
    "so this result comes from the circuit theory\n",
    "\n",
    "它和你能够用电路元件计算哪些函数 有着分不开的联系\n",
    "which pertains to thinking about what types of functions you can compute\n",
    "\n",
    "根据不同的基本逻辑门\n",
    "with different and gates and or gates\n",
    "\n",
    "譬如与门 或门 非门\n",
    "and not gates basically logic gates\n",
    "\n",
    "在非正式的情况下 这些函数都\n",
    "so informally these functions you can\n",
    "\n",
    "可以用相对较小 但很深的神经网络来计算\n",
    "compute with be relatively small but deep neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "小在这里的意思是 隐藏单元的数量相对比较小\n",
    "and by small I mean the number of hidden units is relatively small\n",
    "\n",
    "但是如果你用浅一些的神经网络计算同样的函数\n",
    "but that if you try to compute the same function with a shallow network\n",
    "\n",
    "也就是说在我们不能用很多隐藏层时\n",
    "so we aren't allowed enough hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "你会需要成指数增长的单元数量才能达到同样的计算结果\n",
    "then you might require exponentially more hidden units to compute\n",
    "\n",
    "我再来举个例子 用没那么正式的语言介绍这个概念\n",
    "so let me just give you one example and illustrate this a bit informally\n",
    "\n",
    "假设你想要对输入特征计算异或\n",
    "but let's say you're trying to compute the exclusive-or\n",
    "\n",
    "或是奇偶性\n",
    "or the parity of all your input features\n",
    "\n",
    "你可以算x1 XOR x2 XOR x3 XOR直到xn\n",
    "you can compute x1 XOR x2 XOR x3 XOR up to xn\n",
    "\n",
    "假设你有n或者n_x个特征\n",
    "and if you have n or n_x features\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你画一个异或的树图\n",
    "so if you build an XOR tree like this right\n",
    "\n",
    "先要计算x1 x2的异或\n",
    "so first compute the XOR of x1 x2\n",
    "\n",
    "然后是x3和x4\n",
    "then take x3 and x4 and compute their XOR\n",
    "\n",
    "技术上来说如果你只用或门 还有非门的话\n",
    "and technically if you're just using ands or not gate\n",
    "\n",
    "你可能会需要几层\n",
    "you might need a couple layers\n",
    "\n",
    "才能计算异或函数\n",
    "to compute the XOR function rather than just one layer\n",
    "\n",
    "但是用相对小的电路\n",
    "but with a relatively small circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "你应该就可以计算异或了\n",
    "you can compute the XOR right and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "然后你可以继续建这样的一个异或树图\n",
    "and then you can you know build really an XOR tree like so\n",
    "\n",
    "那么你最后会得到这样的电路\n",
    "and so eventually you have a circuit here that outputs you know the all\n",
    "\n",
    "来输出结果y\n",
    "let's call this y that outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "y帽等于y 也就是输入特征的异或 或是奇偶性\n",
    "y hat equals y the exclusive or the parity of all of these input bits\n",
    "\n",
    "要计算异或关系\n",
    "so to compute the XOR\n",
    "\n",
    "这种树图对应网络的深度应该是O(log(n))\n",
    "the depth of the network will be on the order of log n right this type of XOR tree\n",
    "\n",
    "那么节点的数量和电路部件\n",
    "so the number of nodes and the number of circuit circuit components\n",
    "\n",
    "或是门的数量并不会很大\n",
    "or the number of gates in this network is not that large\n",
    "\n",
    "你也不需要太多门去计算异或\n",
    "you don't need that many gates in order to compute the exclusive-or\n",
    "\n",
    "但是如果你不能使用\n",
    "but now if you're not allowed to use a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "多隐层的神经网络的话 在这个例子中隐层数为O(log n)\n",
    "with multiple hidden layers with in this case order log and hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "比如你被迫只能\n",
    "if you're forced to compute this function\n",
    "\n",
    "用单隐层来计算的话\n",
    "with just one hidden layer right\n",
    "\n",
    "这里全部都指向\n",
    "so you have all these things going into you know\n",
    "\n",
    "从这些隐藏单元到后面这里 再输出y\n",
    "so let's hidden units and then these things then outputs y\n",
    "\n",
    "那么要计算奇偶性 或者异或关系函数\n",
    "then in order to compute the parity of XOR to compute this XOR function\n",
    "\n",
    "就需要这一隐层的单元数呈指数增长才行\n",
    "this hidden layer will need to be exponentially large\n",
    "\n",
    "因为本质上来说你需要\n",
    "because essentially you need to\n",
    "\n",
    "列举耗尽2的n次方种可能的配置\n",

    "\n",
    "异或运算的最终结果是1或0\n",
    "that result in the exclusive or being either 1 or 0\n",
    "\n",
    "那么你最终就会需要\n",
    "so you end up needing a hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "一个隐藏层 其中单元数目随输入比特指数上升\n",
    "that is exponentially large in the number of bits\n",
    "\n",
    "精确的说应该是\n",
    "I think technically you could do this\n",
    "\n",
    "2^(n-1)个隐藏单元数\n",
    "with 2 to the N minus 1 hidden units right but that's the order to the end\n",
