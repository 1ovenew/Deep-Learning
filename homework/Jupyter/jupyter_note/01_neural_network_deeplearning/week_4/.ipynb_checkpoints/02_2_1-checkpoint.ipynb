    "\n",
    "实际上  应用型机器学习是一个高度迭代的过程\n",
    "So in practice applied machine learning is a highly iterative process,\n",
    "\n",
    "通常在项目启动时  我们会先有一个初步想法\n",
    "in which you often start with an idea,\n",
    "\n",
    "比如构建一个含有特定层数  隐藏单元数量\n",

    "\n",
    "或数据集个数等等的神经网络\n",
    "certain number of hidden units, maybe on certain data sets and so on.\n",

    "范围之广  不胜枚举\n",
    "to many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "我发现  可能有自然语言处理方面的人才\n",
    "So what I'm seeing is that sometimes a researcher with a lot of experience in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "想踏足计算机视觉领域\n",
    "might try to do something in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "或者经验丰富的语音识别专家\n",

    "\n",
    "想投身广告行业\n",

    "\n",
    "又或者  有的人想从电脑安全领域跳到物流行业\n",
    "Or someone from security might want to jump in and do something on logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "在我看来  从一个领域或者应用领域得来的直觉经验\n",

    "\n",
    "通常无法转移到其它应用领域\n",

    "\n",
    "最佳决策取决于你所拥有的数据量\n",
    "And the best choices may depend on the amount of data you have,\n",
    "\n",
    "计算机配置中输入特征的数量\n",
    "the number of input features you have through your computer configuration and\n",
    "\n",
    "用GPU训练还是CPU\n",
    "whether you're training on GPUs or CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU和CPU的具体配置以及其他诸多因素\n",
    "And if so, exactly what configuration of GPUs and CPUs, and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "目前为止  我觉得  对于很多应用系统\n",
    "So for a lot of applications, I think it's almost impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "即使是经验丰富的深度学习行家也不太可能一开始就\n",
    "Even very experienced deep learning people find it almost impossible to correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "预设出最匹配的超级参数\n",
    "guess the best choice of hyperparameters the very first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "所以说  应用深度学习是一个典型的迭代过程\n",
    "And so today, applied deep learning is a very iterative process\n",
    "\n",
    "需要多次循环往复\n",
    "where you just have to go around this cycle many times\n",
    "\n",
    "才能为应用程序找到一个称心的神经网络\n",
    "to hopefully find a good choice of network for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "因此  循环该过程的效率是决定\n",
    "So one of the things that determine how quickly you can make progress is\n",
    "\n",
    "项目进展速度的一个关键因素\n",
    "how efficiently you can go around this cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "而创建高质量的训练数据集  验证集和测试集\n",
    "And setting up your data sets well in terms of your train, development and\n",
    "\n",
    "也有助于提高循环效率\n",
    "test sets can make you much more efficient at that.\n",
    "\n",
    "假设这是训练数据  我用一个长方形表示\n",
    "So if this is your training data, let's draw that as a big box.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们通常会将这些数据划分成几部分\n",
    "Then traditionally you might take all the data you have and\n",
    "\n",
    "一部分作为训练集\n",
    "carve off some portion of it to be your training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "一部分作为简单交叉验证集\n",
    "Some portion of it to be your hold-out cross validation set,\n",
    "\n",
    "有时也称之为验证集\n",
    "and this is sometimes also called the development set.\n",
    "\n",
    "方便起见  我就叫它验证集（dev set）\n",
    "And for brevity, I'm just going to call this the dev set, but\n",
    "\n",
    "其实都是同一个概念\n",
    "all of these terms mean roughly the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "最后一部分则作为测试集\n",
    "And then you might carve out some final portion of it to be your test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "接下来  我们开始对训练集执行训练算法\n",
    "And so the workflow is that you keep on training algorithms on your training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "通过验证集或简单交叉验证集\n",
    "And use your dev set or your hold-out cross validation set to see which\n",
    "\n",
    "通过验证集或简单交叉验证集选择最好的模型\n",
    "of many different models performs best on your dev set.\n",
    "\n",
    "经过充分验证\n",
    "And then after having done this long enough,\n",
    "\n",
    "我们选定了最终模型\n",
    "when you have a final model that you want to evaluate,\n",
    "\n",
    "然后就可以在测试集上进行评估了\n",
    "you can take the best model you have found and evaluate it on your test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "为了无偏评估算法的运行状况\n",
    "In order to get an unbiased estimate of how well your algorithm is doing,\n",
    "\n",
    "在机器学习发展的小数据量时代\n",
    "so in the previous era of machine learning, it was common practice\n",
    "\n",
    "常见做法是将所有数据三七分\n",
    "to take all your data and split it according to maybe a 70/30%\n",
    "\n",
    "就是人们常说的70%验证集  30%测试集\n",
    "in terms of a people often talk about the 70/30 train test splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果没有明确设置验证集  也可以按照\n",
    "If you don't have an explicit dev set or maybe a 60/20/20% split\n",
    "\n",
    "60%训练  20%验证和20%测试集来划分\n",
    "in terms of 60% train, 20% dev and 20% test.\n",
    "\n",
    "这是前几年机器学习领域普遍认可的最好的实践方法\n",
    "And several years ago, this was widely considered best practice in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果只有100条\n",
    "If you have maybe 100 examples in total,\n",
    "\n",
    "1000条或者1万条数据\n",
    "maybe 1000 examples in total, maybe after 10,000 examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "那么按上述比例划分是非常合理的\n",
    "These sorts of ratios were perfectly reasonable rules of thumb.\n",
    "\n",
    "但是在大数据时代\n",
    "But in the modern big data era, where, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "我们现在的数据量可能是百万级别\n",
    "you might have a million examples in total, then the trend is that your dev and\n",
    "\n",
    "那么验证集和测试集占数据总量的比例会趋向于变得更小\n",
    "test sets have been becoming a much smaller percentage of the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "因为验证集的目的就是验证不同的算法\n",
    "Because remember, the goal of the dev set or the development set is that you're\n",
    "\n",
    "检验哪种算法更有效\n",
    "going to test different algorithms on it and see which algorithm works better.\n",
    "\n",
    "因此  验证集要足够大才能评估\n",
    "So the dev set just needs to be big enough for\n",
    "\n",
    "比如2个甚至10个不同算法\n",
    "you to evaluate, say, two different algorithm choices or\n",
    "\n",
    "并迅速判断出哪种算法更有效\n",
    "ten different algorithm choices and quickly decide which one is doing better.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们可能不需要拿出20%的数据作为验证集\n",
    "And you might not need a whole 20% of your data for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "比如我们有100万条数据\n",
    "So, for example, if you have a million training examples you might decide that\n",
    "\n",
    "那么取1万条数据便足以进行评估\n",
    "just having 10,000 examples in your dev set is more than enough\n",
    "\n",
    "找出其中表现最好的1-2种算法\n",
    "to evaluate which one or two algorithms does better.\n",
    "\n",
    "同样地  根据最终选择的分类器\n",
    "And in a similar vein, the main goal of your test set is, given your final classifier,\n",
    "\n",
    "测试集的主要目的是正确评估分类器的性能\n",
    "to give you a pretty confident estimate of how well it's doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "所以  如果拥有百万数据  我们只需要1000条数据\n",
    "And again, if you have a million examples maybe you might decide that 10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "便足以评估单个分类器\n",
    "examples is more than enough in order to evaluate a single classifier and\n",
    "\n",
    "准确评估该分类器的性能\n",
    "give you a good estimate of how well it's doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "假设我们有100万条数据\n",
    "So in this example where you have a million examples,\n",
    "\n",
    "其中1万条作验证集  1万条作测试集\n",
    "if you need just 10,000 for your dev and 10,000 for your test,\n",
    "\n",
    "100万里取1万  比例是1%\n",
    "your ratio will be more like this 10,000 is 1% of 1 million,\n",
    "\n",
    "即：训练集占98%  验证集和测试集各占1%\n",
    "so you'll have 98% train, 1% dev, 1% test.\n",
    "\n",
    "对于数据量过百万的应用\n",
    "And I've also seen applications where,\n",
    "\n",
    "训练集可以占到99.5%\n",
    "if you have even more than a million examples, you might end up\n",
    "\n",
    "验证和测试集各占0.25%\n",
    "with 99.5% train and 0.25% dev, 0.25% test,\n",
    "\n",
    "或者测试集占0.4%  测试集占0.1%\n",
    "or maybe a 0.4% dev, 0.1% test.\n",
    "\n",
    "总结一下  在机器学习中\n",
    "So just to recap, when setting up your machine learning problem,\n",
    "\n",
    "我们通常将样本分成训练集  验证集和测试集三部分\n",
    "I'll often set it up into a train, dev and test sets, and\n",
    "\n",
    "数据集规模相对较小的  适用传统的划分比例\n",
    "if you have a relatively small dataset, these traditional ratios might be okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "数据集规模较大的  验证集和测试集可以占到\n",
    "But if you have a much larger data set, it's also fine to set your dev and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "数据总量的20%或10%以下\n",
    "to be much smaller than your 20% or even 10% of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "后面我会给出如何划分验证集和测试集的具体指导\n",
    "We'll give more specific guidelines on the sizes of dev and test sets later in this specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "现代深度学习的另一个趋势是  越来越多的人\n",
    "One other trend we're seeing in the era of modern deep learning is that\n",
    "\n",
    "在训练和测试集分布不匹配的情况下进行训练\n",
    "more and more people train on mismatched train and test distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "假设你要构建一个用户可以上传大量图片的应用程序\n",
    "Let's say you're building an app that lets users upload a lot of pictures\n",
    "\n",
    "目的是找出并呈现所有猫咪图片\n",
    "and your goal is to find pictures of cats in order to show your users.\n",
    "\n",
    "可能你的用户都是爱猫人士\n",
    "Maybe all your users are cat lovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "训练集可能是从网上下载的猫咪图片\n",
    "Maybe your training set comes from cat pictures downloaded off the Internet, but\n",
    "\n",
    "而验证集和测试集是用户在这个应用上上传的猫的图片\n",
    "your dev and test sets might comprise cat pictures from users using our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "就是说  训练集可能是从网络上抓下来的图片\n",
    "So maybe your training set has a lot of pictures crawled off the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "而验证集和测试集是用户上传的图片\n",
    "but the dev and test sets are pictures uploaded by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "结果许多网页上的猫咪图片分辨率很高\n",
    "Turns out a lot of webpages have very high resolution, very professional,\n",
    "\n",
    "很专业  后期制作精良\n",
    "very nicely framed pictures of cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "130\n",
    "00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,850\n",
    "而用户上传的照片可能是用手机随意拍摄的\n",
    "But maybe your users are uploading blurrier, lower res images\n",
    "\n",
    "像素低  比较模糊\n",
    "just taken with a cell phone camera in a more casual condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "这两类数据有所不同\n",
    "And so these two distributions of data may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "针对这种情况  根据经验  我建议大家\n",
    "The rule of thumb I'd encourage you to follow in this case is to make sure\n",
    "\n",
    "要确保验证集和测试集的数据来自同一分布\n",
    "that the dev and test sets come from the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "关于这个问题我也会多讲一些\n",
    "We'll say more about this particular guideline as well, but\n",
    "\n",
    "因为你们要用验证集来评估不同的模型\n",
    "because you will be using the dev set to evaluate a lot of different models and\n",
    "\n",
    "尽可能地优化性能\n",
    "trying really hard to improve performance on the dev set.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果验证集和测试集来自同一个分布\n",
    "It's nice if your dev set comes from the same distribution as your test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "但由于深度学习算法需要大量的训练数据\n",
    "But because deep learning algorithms have such a huge hunger for training data,\n",
    "\n",
    "为了获取更大规模的训练数据集\n",
    "one trend I'm seeing is that you might use all sorts of creative tactics,\n",
    "\n",
    "我们可以采用当前流行的各种创意策略\n",
    "such as crawling webpages, in order to acquire a much bigger\n",
    "\n",
    "例如  网页抓取\n",
    "training set than you would otherwise have.\n",
    "\n",
    "代价就是训练集数据与验证集和测试集数据\n",
    "Even if part of the cost of that is then that your training set\n",
    "\n",
    "有可能不是来自同一分布\n",
    "data might not come from the same distribution as your dev and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "但只要遵循这个经验法则\n",
    "But you find that so long as you follow this rule of thumb,\n",
    "\n",
    "你会发现  机器学习算法会变得更快\n",
    "that progress in your machine learning algorithm will be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "我会在后面的课程中  And I'll give a more detailed explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "更加详细地解释这条经验法则\n",
    "for this particular rule of thumb later in the specialization as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "最后一点  就算没有测试集也不要紧\n",
    "Finally, it might be okay to not have a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "测试集的目的是对\n",
    "Remember the goal of the test set is to give you a unbiased estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "最终所选定的神经网络系统做出无偏评估\n",
    "of the performance of your final network, of the network that you selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果不需要无偏评估\n",
    "But if you don't need that unbiased estimate,\n",
    "\n",
    "也可以不设置测试集\n",
    "then it might be okay to not have a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "所以如果只有验证集  没有测试集\n",
    "So what you do, if you have only a dev set but not a test set,\n",
    "\n",
    "我们要做的就是  在训练集上训练  尝试不同的模型框架\n",
    "is you train on the training set and then you try different model architectures,\n",
    "\n",
    "在验证集上评估这些模型\n",
    "evaluate them on the dev set,\n",
    "\n",
    "然后迭代并选出适用的模型\n",
    "and then use that to iterate and try to get to a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "因为验证集中已经涵盖测试集数据\n",
    "Because you've fit your data to the dev set,\n",
    "\n",
    "其不再提供无偏性能评估\n",
    "this no longer gives you an unbiased estimate of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "当然  如果你不需要无偏评估  那就再好不过了\n",
    "But if you don't need one, that might be perfectly fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "在机器学习中  如果只有一个训练集和一个验证集\n",
    "In the machine learning world, when you have just a train and\n",
    "\n",
    "而没有独立的测试集\n",
    "a dev set but no separate test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "遇到这种情况 训练集还被人们称为训练集\n",
    "Most people will call this a training set\n",
    "\n",
    "而验证集则被称为测试集\n",
    "and they will call the dev set the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "不过在实际应用中  人们只是把测试集当成简单交叉验证集使用\n",
    "But what they actually end up doing is using the test set as a hold-out cross validation set,\n",
    "\n",
    "并没有完全实现该术语的功能\n",
    "which maybe isn't completely a great use of terminology,\n",
    "\n",
    "因为他们把验证集数据过度拟合到了测试集中\n",
    "because they're then overfitting to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果某团队跟你说他们只设置了一个训练集和一个测试集\n",
