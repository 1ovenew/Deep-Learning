    "welcome to the fourth week of this course,by now you've seen forward propagation and back propagation in the context of a neural network with a single hidden layer\n",

    "欢迎听讲第四周的课程，到现在为止你应该见过\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "单隐层神经网络中的前向和后向传播\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "以及logistic回归\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "，并且也学了向量化\n",
    ",and you've learned about vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "，和为什么随机初始化比较重要\n",
    ",and why it's important initialized the weight randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果你已经完成了之前的作业\n",
    ",if you've done the past week's homework\n",
    "\n",
    "，我们也已经亲自实现过一些理念\n",
    ",we've also implemented and seen some of these ideas work for yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "，所以到现在你应该已经看过大多数的\n",
    ",so by now you've actually seen most of the ideas you need\n",
    "\n",
    "，实现深度神经网络的理念\n",
    ",to implement a deep neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "，这周我们将会学习如何把这些理念组合起来\n",
    ",what we're going to do in this week is take those ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "，从而实现你自己的\n",
    ",and put them together so that you'll\n",
    "\n",
    "，深度神经网络模型\n",
    ",be able to implement your own deep neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "， 因为这周的练习题目会更长\n",
    ",because this we problem exercise is longer\n",
    "\n",
    "，可能会需要更多时间完成\n",
    ",and just has a bit more work\n",
    "\n",
    "， 这周的视频会稍微剪短一些\n",
    ",going to keep the video so this week shorter\n",
    "\n",
    "， 所以你可以更快一点看完视频\n",
    ",as you get to the videos a little bit more quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "， 就有更多的时间\n",
    ",and then I'll have more time to do\n",
    "\n",
    "， 在之后做一个编程大作业\n",
    ",a significant program exercise at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "， 希望你能够搭建\n",
    ",which I hope will leave you having built\n",
    "\n",
    "，一个能让你引以为傲的深度学习模型\n",
    ",a deep neural network that you feel proud of\n",
