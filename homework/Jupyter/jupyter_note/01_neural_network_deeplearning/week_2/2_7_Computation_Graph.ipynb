    "probably say that the computations of a neural network,are all organized in terms of,a forward path or a forward propagation step,in which we compute the output of the neural network,followed by a backward pass or a back complication step,which we use to compute gradients or compute derivatives.the computation graph explains why it is organized this way,in this video we'll go through an example,in order to illustrate the computation graph.let's use a simpler example than logistic regression,or a informal neural network.\n",

    "let's say that we're trying to compute a function J,which is a function of three variables a b and c,and let's say that function is three times a plus B times C,computing this function actually has three distinct steps,the first is you need to compute,what is B times C,and let's say we store that in a variable called u,so U is equal to B times C,and then you might compute v is equal a times u (a+u),so let's say you know this is V,and then finally your output J is 3 times V,so this is your final function J you trying to compute,we can take these three steps,and draw them in a computation graph as follows,let's say I draw your three variables a B and C here,so the first thing we did was compute u equals B times C.\n",
    "\n",

    "我们尝试计算函数J，J是三个变量a b c的函数，这个函数是3(a+b*c)，计算这个函数 实际上有三个不同的步骤，第一个首先是，计算b乘以c，我们把它储存在变量u中，因此u=b*c，然后计算v=a+u(原说法有误)，这就是v，最后输出J 就是3*v，这就是要计算的函数J，我们可以把这三步，画成如下的流程图，我先在这画三个变量a b c，第一步就是计算u=b*c。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to put a rectangular box around that,and so the inputs of that are B and C,and then you might have V equals a plus u,so the inputs to that ah so the inputs to,that are u which we just computed together with a,and then finally we have J equals three times v,so as I can  for example a equals five B equals 3,and C equals two  then u equals BC would be six,V equals a plus u be five plus six and eleven,J is three times v so J is equal to 33,and indeed hope you can verify that you know,this is a three times five plus three times two,and ifyou expand that out,you know you actually get thirty three is the value of J,so the computation graph comes in handy,when there is some distinguished or some special output variable,such as J in this case that you want to optimize,and in the case of the logistic regression,J is of course the cost function that we're trying to minimize,and what we've seen in this little example is that,through a left-to-right pause you can compute the value of J\n",
    "\n",
    "我在这周围 放个矩形框，它的输入是b和c，接着第二步 v=a+u，这个的输入就是，刚才计算出来的u 还有a，最后一步 J=3*v，举个例子 a=5 b=3，c=2 u=bc 就是6，v=a+u 就是5+6 就是11，J是三倍的v 因此 J就等于33，你们自己可以验证以下，这是3*（5+3*2），如果你把它算出来，实际上得到33 就是J的值，这个流程图用起来很方便，有不同的 或者一些特殊的输出变量时，比如J也是我们想要优化，在logistic回归中，J是想要最小化的成本函数，可以看出 通过一个，从左向右的过程 你可以计算出J的值\n",

    "In the last video, we worked through an example of,using a computation graph to compute the function J.Now, let's take a cleaned up version,of that computation graph and show how you can use it,to figure out derivative calculations for that function J.So, here's a computation graph.Let's say you want to compute,the derivative of J with respect to v. So, what is that?Well, this says if we were to,take this value of v and change it a little bit,how would the value of J change?Well, J is defined as three times v,and right now v is equal to 11.So, if we're to pump up v by a little bit to 11.001,then J which has three vs and currently 33 will get pumped up to 33.003.So, here we've increased v by .001 and the net result of that is that J goes up three times as much.So the derivative of J with respect to v is equal to three,because the increase in J is three times the increase in v.\n",
    "\n",
    "在上个视频中 我们看了一个例子，使用流程图来计算函数J，现在我们清理一下，流程图的描述 看看你如何利用它，计算出函数J的导数，所以这是一个流程图，假设你要计算，J对v的导数 那怎么算呢?好 比如说 我们要，把这个v值拿过来 改变一下，那么J的值会怎么变呢?，所以定义上 J是3v，现在v等于11，所以如果你让v增加一点点 比如到11.001，那么J是3v，现在33就增加到33.003，所以我这里v增加了0.001 然后，最终结果是J上升到原来的三倍，所以J对v的导数就等于3，因为对于任何v的增量 J都会有三倍增量\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and, in fact, this is very analogous to,the example we had in the previous video,where we had f(a) equals 3a.,and so, we then derive,that df(a)/da which was slightly simplified,and slightly sloppy notation,you can read as df/da was equal to three.So, instead, here we have J equals 3v,and so dJ/dv is equal to three,with here J playing the role of f,and v playing the role of a in,this previous example that we had right from an earlier video.In the terminology of backpropagation what we've seen is that,if you want to compute,the derivative of this final output variable,which uses variable you care most about,with respect to v,then we're done sort of one step of backpropagation,so the called one step backwards in this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "而且这类似于，我们在上一个视频中的例子，我们有f(a)=3a，然后我们推导出，那个df(a)/da 就是稍微化简之后的，有点随便的写法，你可以看成df/da=3，所以这里我们有J=3v，所以dJ/dv就等于3，这里J扮演了f的角色，v扮演了a的角色，在之前的视频里的例子，在反向传播算法中的术语 我们看到，如果你想计算，最后输出变量的导数，使用你最关心的变量，对v的导数，那么我们就做完了一步反向传播，在这个流程图中是一个反向步\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at another example.What is dJ/da?In other words, if we pump up the value of a,how does that affect the value of J?Well, let's go through the example.variable a is equal to five.So let's pump it up to 5.001.The net impact of that is that v which was a plus U,so that was previous 11,this we can increase to 11.001.and then we've already seen as abovethat J now gets bumped up to 33.003.So, what we've seen is that if you increase a by 0.001,J increases by 0.003.and by increase a I mean if you were to take this value 5 and just plug in the new value,\n",
    "then the change to a will propagate to the right of the computation graph.So that J ends up being 33.003.and so, the increase to J is three times the increase to a.That means this derivative is equal to three.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们来看另一个例子，dJ/da是多少呢?换句话说 如果我们提高a的数值，对J的数值有什么影响?好 我们看看这个例子，变量a=5，我们让它增加到5.001，那么对v的影响就是a+U，之前是11，现在变成11.001，我们从上面看到，现在J就变成33.003了，所以我们看到的是 如果你让a增加0.001，J增加0.003，那么增加a 我是说，如果你把这个5换成某个新值，那么a的改变量，就会传播到流程图的最右，所以J最后是33.003，所以J的增量是3乘以a的增量，意味着这个导数是3，\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to break this down is to say that if you change a then that would change v,and through changing v,that would change J.and so, the net change to the value of J,when you bump up the value,when you nudge the value of a up a little bit is that,first, by changing a you end up increasing v. Well,how much does v increase?It is increased by an amount that's determined by dv/da and then the change in v will cause the value of J to also increase.So, in Calculus this is actually called the chain rule,that's if a affects v affects J,then the amount that J changes when you nudge a is the product of how much v changes when you nudge a,times how much J changes when you nudge v.So in Calculus again this is called the chain rule.What we saw from this calculation is that if you increase a by 0.001,v changes by the same amount.So dv/da is equal to one.So in fact if you plug in what we have worked up previously on dJ/dv is equal to three and dv/da is equal to one,so the product of this, three times one.That actually gives you the correct value that dJ/da is equal to three.This little illustration shows how by having computed dJ/dv had this derivative with respect to this variable,it can then help you to compute dJ/da.and so, that's another step of this backward calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "要解释这个计算过程其中一种方式是，就是如果你改变了a 那也会改变v，通过改变v，也会改变J，所以J值的净变化量，当你提升这个值，当你把a值提高一点点 这就是J的变化量，首先 a增加了 v也会增加，v增加多少呢?，增加了一个量，这取决于dv/da 然后v的变化，导致J也在增加，所以这在微积分里实际上叫链式法则，如果a影响到v影响到J，那么当你让a变大时 J的变化量，就是当你改变a时v的变化量乘以，改变v时 J的变化量，在微积分里这叫链式法则，我们从这个计算中看到，如果你让a增加0.001，v也会变化相同的大小，所以dv/da就等于1，事实上 如果你代入进去 我们之前算过，dJ/dv等于3 dv/da等于1，所以这个乘积 3×1，实际上就给出了正确答案，dJ/da就等于3，这张小图表示了 如何计算，dJ/dv 就是这个对这个变量的导数，它可以帮你计算dJ/da，所以这是另一步反向传播计算。\n",

    "So the key takeaway from this video,from this example is that,when computing derivatives in computing all of these derivatives,the most efficient way to do so,is through a right to left computation following the direction of the red arrows.and in particular, we'll first compute the derivatives respect to v,and then that becomes useful for computing the derivative respect a,and the derivative respect to u.and then, derivative respect to u, for example,this term over here and this term over here, those, in turn,become useful for computing the derivative respect to b,and the derivative respect to c. So that wasa computation graph and how there's a forward or left to right calculation to compute the cost functions such as j,do you might want to optimize.and a backwards or a right to left calculation to compute derivatives.If you're not familiar with calculus or the chain rule,I know some of those details are gone by really quickly.But if you didn't follow all the details, don't worry about it.In the next video, we'll go over this again,in the context of logistic regression,and show you exactly what you need to do,in order to implement the computations you need,to compute derivatives through the logistic regression model.\n",

    "所以这个视频的要点是，对于那个例子，当计算所有这些导数时，最有效率的办法是，从右到左计算，跟着这个红色箭头走，特别是 当我们第一次计算对v的导数时，之后在计算对a导数就可以用到，对u的导数，然后对u的导数 比如说，这个项和这里这个项，可以帮助计算对b的导数，然后对c的导数 所以这是，一个计算流程图 就是正向，或者说从左到右的计算 来计算成本函数j，你可能需要优化的函数，然后反向从右到左计算导数，如果你不熟悉微积分或链式法则，我知道这里有些细节讲的很快，但如果你没跟上所有细节 也不用怕，在下一个视频中 我会再过一遍，在logistic回归的背景下过一遍，并给你们介绍需要做什么，才能编写代码，实现logistic回归模型中的导数计算\n",
