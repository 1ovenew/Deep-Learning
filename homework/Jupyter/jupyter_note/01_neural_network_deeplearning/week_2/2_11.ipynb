    "Welcome back. Vectorization is basically,the art of getting rid of explicit for loops in your code.In the deep learning era safety in deep learning in practice,you often find yourself training on relatively large data sets,because that's when deep learning algorithms tend to shine.And so, it's important that your code very quickly because otherwise,if it's running on a big data set,your code might take a long time to run,then you just find yourself waiting a very long time to get the result.So in the deep learning era.\n",
    "\n",
    "欢迎回来 向量化通常是，消除你的代码中显式for循环语句的艺术，在深度学习安全领域、深度学习、练习中，你经常发现在训练大数据集时，深度学习算法表现才更加优越，所以你的代码运行得非常快非常重要 否则，如果它运行在一个大的数据集上面，你的代码可能花费很长时间去运行，你会发现 你将要等待非常长的时间去得到结果，所以在深度学习领域\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the ability to perform vectorization has become a key skill.Let's start with an example.So, what is Vectorization?In logistic regression you need to compute z equals W transpose X plus B,where W was this column vector and X is also this vector.Maybe there are very large vectors if you have a lot of features.So, w and x were both these RnX dimensional vectors.So, to compute W transpose X,if you had a non-vectorized implementation,you would do something like z equals zero.And then for I in range of n-X.So, for i equals 1, to n_x,`z+=w[i]*x[i]`\n",
    "And then maybe you do z+=b at the end.So, that's a non-vectorized implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "我认为可以去完成向量化以及变成一个关键的技巧，让我们用一个例子开始，什么是向量化？，在Logistic回归中，你需要去计算z=w^Tx+b，w是列向量 x也是列向量，如果你有很多的特征 它们就是非常大的向量，所以w和x都是R内的nx维向量，所以去计算W'X，如果你有一个非向量化的实现，你将会做一些事情 例如z=0，python代码 for i in range(n-x)，python代码  for i in range(n_x)，然后z+=w[i]*x[i]，最后z+=b，所以 这是一个非向量化的实现\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you find that that's going to be really slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "你会发现这是真的很慢，作为对比 一个向量化的实现\n",
    "In contrast, a vectorized implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "，将会非常直接计算W^T X\n",
    "would just compute W transpose X directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "，在Python 或者numpy\n",
    "In Python or a numpy,\n",
    "\n",
    "，你要用命令 z=np.dot(w,x)\n",
    "the command you use for that is z=np.dot(w,x)\n",
    "\n",
    "，这是在计算w^Tx\n",
    "so this computes w transpose x.\n",
    "\n",
    "，后面直接加上b\n",
    "And you can also just add b to that directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "，你将会发现这个非常快\n",
    "And you find that this is much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们用一个小例子说明一下\n",
    "Let's actually illustrate this with a little demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "，在我的jupyter notebook\n",
    "So, here's my jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "，我将会写一些Python代码\n",
    "in which I'm going to write some Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "，首先 让我们导入numpy库\n",
    "So, first, let me import the numpy library to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "，作为 np 例如\n",
    "Send nP. And so, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "，像下面这样我将要创建一个数组A\n",
    "I can create A as an array as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们看下printA\n",
    "Let's say print A.\n",
    "\n",
    "，现在 写下这些代码块\n",
    "Now, having written this chunk of code,\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果我在键盘敲击shift 和 enter 两个键\n",
    "if I hit shift enter,\n",
    "\n",
    "，它将要执行这个代码\n",
    "then it executes the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "，所以 它创建了数组A以及print它\n",
    "So, it created the array A and it prints it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "，现在 让我们完成向量化的例子\n",
    "Now, let's do the Vectorization demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "，我将要导入time库 因为我要使用那个\n",
    "I'm going to import the time libraries, since we use that,\n",
    "\n",
    "，为了去计算两次不同的操作花费了多长时间\n",
    "in order to time how long different operations take.\n",
    "\n",
    "，它们能创建一个数组A吗\n",
    "Can they create an array A?\n",
    "\n",
    "，通过rand函数随机得到\n",
    "Those random thought rand.\n",
    "\n",
    "，用随机值创建了一个百万维度的数组\n",
    "This creates a million dimensional array with random values.\n",
    "\n",
    "，b 等于 np.random.rand.\n",
    "b = np.random.rand.\n",
    "\n",
    "，另外一个百万维度的数组\n",
    "Another million dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "，现在 tic=time.time 记录一下当前时间\n",
    "And, now, tic=time.time, so this measure the current time,\n",
    "\n",
    "，c 等于 np.dot (a, b).\n",
    "c = np.dot (a, b).\n",
    "\n",
    "，toc 等于 time.time.\n",
    "toc = time.time.\n",
    "\n",
    "，print一下\n",
    "And this print,\n",
    "\n",
    "，向量化的版本\n",
    "it is the vectorized version.\n",
    "\n",
    "，这是一个向量化的版本\n",
    "It's a vectorize version.\n",
    "\n",
    "，现在让我们print一下\n",
    "And so, let's print out.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们看一下运行时间\n",
    "Let's see the last time,\n",
    "\n",
    "，这是 toc - tic x 1000\n",
    "so there's toc - tic x 1000,\n",
    "\n",
    "，所以我们表达这个在毫秒级上\n",
    "so that we can express this in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "，ms代表毫秒\n",
    "So, ms is milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "，我将要同时敲击Shift和 Enter\n",
    "I'm going to hit Shift Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "，所以这个代码花费3毫秒或者这个时间的1.5倍\n",
    "So, that code took about three milliseconds or this time 1.5,\n",
    "\n",
    "，或许大概 1.5 或者3.5毫秒\n",
    "maybe about 1.5 or 3.5 milliseconds at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "，它有点变化当我再次运行它的时候\n",
    "It varies a little bit as I run it,\n",
    "\n",
    "，但是好像 平均她要花费1.5毫秒\n",
    "but looks like maybe on average it's taking like 1.5 milliseconds,\n",
    "\n",
    "，或许我这次运行是2毫秒\n",
    "maybe two milliseconds as I run this.\n",
    "\n",
    "，是的\n",
    "All right.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们继续增加这个代码\n",
    "Let's keep adding to this block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "，这是非向量化的版本\n",
    "That's not implementing non-vectorize version.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们看看 c=0\n",
    "Let's see, c = 0,\n",
    "\n",
    "，then tic = time.time.\n",
    "tic = time.time.\n",
    "\n",
    "，现在它实现了一个for 循环\n",
    "Now, let's implement a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "，python 代码:for i in range 1:1000000\n",
    "For I in range of 1 million,\n",
    "\n",
    "，我将要取出0右边的数字\n",
    "I'll pick out the number of zeros right.\n",
    "\n",
    "，而C += (a,i) x (b,i)\n",
    "C += (a,i) x (b,i),\n",
    "\n",
    "，以及 toc = time.time.\n",
    "and then toc = time.time.\n",
    "\n",
    "，最后 printfor loop\n",
    "Finally, print more than explicit for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "，它花费的时间是1000*toc-tic ms\n",
    "The time it takes is this 1000 x toc - tic + \"ms\"\n",
    "\n",
    "，为了知道我们正在做这个在毫秒级别\n",
    "to know that we're doing this in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们再做点其他的事情\n",
    "Let's do one more thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "，我们print出C的值。\n",
    "Let's just print out the value of C\n",
    "\n",
    "，计算一下它 确认在两个案例中他们是相同的。\n",
    "we compute it to make sure that it's the same value in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "，我打算去敲击shift和enter去运行这个 检查一下结果\n",
    "I'm going to hit shift enter to run this and check that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "，在两个案例中 向量化版本\n",
    "In both cases, the vectorize version\n",
    "\n",
    "，和非向量化版本计算了相同的值\n",
    "and the non-vectorize version computed the same values,\n",
    "\n",
    "，正如你知道的 2.50 到 6.99\n",
    "as you know, 2.50 to 6.99, so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "，向量化版本花费了1.5毫秒\n",
    "The vectorize version took 1.5 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "，很明确 for loop和非向量化版本\n",
    "The explicit for loop and non-vectorize version\n",
    "\n",
    "，花费了大约400 几乎500毫秒\n",
    "took about 400, almost 500 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "，非向量化版本多花费了\n",
    "The non-vectorize version took\n",
    "\n",
    "，300倍向量化版本的时间\n",
    "something like 300 times longer than the vectorize version.\n",
    "\n",
    "，用这个例子你将会看见\n",
    "With this example you see that\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果你仅仅记住去向量化你的代码\n",
    "if only you remember to vectorize your code,\n",
    "\n",
    "，你的代码完全运行300倍快\n",
    "your code actually runs over 300 times faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "，让我们再次运行一下它\n",
    "Let's just run it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "，再次运行一下它\n",
    "Just run it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "，向量化版本1.5毫秒 循环使用了\n",
    "Yeah. Vectorize version 1.5 milliseconds seconds and the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "，481毫秒\n",
    "So 481 milliseconds, again,\n",
    "\n",
    "，大约慢300倍用循环做这个\n",
    "about 300 times slower to do the explicit for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果时间变慢\n",
    "If the time slows down,\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果你的代码一分钟就出结果\n",
    "it's the difference between your code taking maybe one minute to\n",
    "\n",
    "，那和5个小时出结果相差太远了\n",
    "run versus taking say five hours to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "，当你正在实现深度学习算法\n",
    "And when you are implementing deep learning algorithms,\n",
    "\n",
    "，这样真的可以更快得到结果\n",
    "you can really get a result back faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "，向量化之后 运行速度会大幅上升\n",
    "It will be much faster if you vectorize your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "，你可能听过很多这样的话\n",
    "Some of you might have heard that a lot of\n",
    "\n",
    "，可扩展深度学习实现是在GPU上做的\n",
    "scaleable deep learning implementations are done on a GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "，GPU也叫图像处理单元\n",
    "or a graphics processing unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "，但是我做的所有的案例都是在jupyter notebook上面实现\n",
    "But all the demos I did just now in the jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "，这里只有CPU\n",
    "where actually on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "，CPU和GPU\n",
    "And it turns out that both GPU and CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "，都有并行化的指令\n",
    "have parallelization instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "，有时候会叫做SIMD指令\n",
    "They're sometimes called SIMD instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "，意思是单指令流多数据流\n",
    "This stands for a single instruction multiple data.\n",
    "\n",
    "，这个词的意思是\n",
    "But what this basically means is that,\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果你使用了这样的内置函数\n",
    "if you use built-in functions such as this\n",
    "\n",
    "，np.function 或者\n",
    "np.function or other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "，其他能让你去掉显式for循环的函数\n",
    "that don't require you explicitly implementing a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "，这样python的numpy能够充分利用并行化\n",
    "It enables Python numpy to take much better advantage of parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "，去更快的计算\n",
    ",to do your computations much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "，这点对GPU和CPU上面计算都是成立的\n",
    "And this is true both computations on CPUs and computations on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "，GPU更加擅长SIMD计算\n",
    ",It's just that GPUs are remarkably good at these SIMD calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "，但是CPU事实上也不是太差\n",
    ",but CPU is actually also not too bad at that.\n",
    "\n",
    "，可能没有GPU那么擅长吧\n",
    ",Maybe just not as good as GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "，你们见到了向量化能够加速你的代码\n",
    ",You're seeing how vectorization can significantly speed up your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "，经验法则是 只要有其他可能 就不要使用显式for循环\n",
