    "in this video and show you a slightly more complex example,where the slope of the function,can be different at different points in the function,let's start with an example,here I plot to a function f of a equals a squared.let's take a look at the point in equals two,so a squared or F of a is equal to four.let's nudge a slightly to the right so,now a is equal to two point zero zero one,f of a which is a squared is,going to be approximately four point zero zero four,it turns out that the exact value,if you call the calculator and figure this out is,actually four point zero zero four zero zero one,now I'm just to say a 4.04 is close enough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "在这个视频中 我将给出一个更加复杂的例子,在这个例子中，函数在不同点处的斜率是不一样的，先来举个例子，我在这里画一个函数 f(a)等于a的平方，来看看 a等于2的点，在这个点上 a的平方等于4，让我们稍稍往右推进一点点，现在a等于2.001，而f(a) 即a的平方，约为4.004，但是 如果你用计算器算的话，这个准确的值应该为，4.004001，为了简便起见 省略了后面的部分\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",so what this means is that when a is equal to two.let's draw this on the plot,so what we're saying is that,if a is equal to 2 then F of a is equal to 4,and here at the x and y axes are not drawn to scale,technically this vertical height,should be much higher than this horizontal height,so the x and y axes are not on the same scale,but if I now nudge a to 2.001 then F of a,becomes roughly 4.004 so if you draw this,little triangle again what this means is,that if I nudge a to the right by 0.001,f of a goes up four times as much by 0.004,so in the language of calculus we say,that the slope that is the derivative,from F of a at a equals 2 is 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "，这里想表达的是 当a=2时，我们重新在图上画一下，如果a=2的话，那么f(a)=4，这里x轴和y轴的比例 还是不太准确，实际上这个点的高度，要比这里纵轴的x值，还要大那么一点点 x轴和y轴不成比例的，如果让a=2.001，则f(a)约为4.004 如果你在这儿画，一个小三角形 你就会发现，如果把a往右移动0.001，那么f(a)将增大四倍 即增大0.004，在微积分中 我们把这个，此三角形斜边的斜率，f(a)在点a=2处的导数 等于4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",or to write this out with calculus notation,we say that d/da of f of a is equal to 4,when a is equal to 2 now one thing about,this function f of a equals a square is,that the slope is different for different values of a,this is different and the example we saw on the previous slide,so let's look at a different point,if a is equal to 5 so except equals 2,now you have a equals 5 then a squared is equal to 25,so that's f of a if I nudge a to the right again,it's tiny little nudge of a so now a is 5.001,then F of a will be approximately 25.010,so what we see is that by nudging a up by 0.001,F of a goes up 10 times as much,so we have that d da f of a is equal to 10 when a is equal to 5,because F of a goes up 10 times as much as a does,when I make a tiny little nudge to a so one way to see\n",
    "\n",
    "，或者写成微积分的形式，当a=2的时候，d/da f(a)=4 由此可知，函数f(a)=a^2，a取不同值的时候，它的斜率是不同的 这和上个视频中的例子不一样，现在换个点来看，如果a=5 不再等于2，a=5  a的平方为25，这是f(a)的值 如果再一次把a往右移一点点，只是移动非常小的一段距离 让a=5.001，而f(a)的值大约为25.010，当我们只往右移动了0.001时，f(a)却增大了10倍，即可以写作 d/da f(a)=10，此时a的值为5 这里只是小小地移动了a，f(a)的值增大了10倍 有种直观的方法可以解释\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",why the derivative is different at,different points is that if you draw,that here a little triangle right at different locations on this,you see that the ratio of the height of the triangle,over the width of the triangle is very different,at different points on the curve,so here the slope is equal to 4,when a is equal to 2 but is equal to 10,when a is equal to 5 now if you pull up,a calculus textbook a calculus textbook will tell you that,d/da of f of a so f of a is equal to a square,so that d/da of a squared,one of the formulas you find that the calculus textbook is that,this thing the slope of the function a squared is equal to 2a.I'm not going to prove this,but the way you find yours out is that,you open up a calculus textbooks to the table formulas,and it'll tell you the derivative of two of a squared,is equal to 2a and indeed,this is consistent with what we've worked out mainly,when a is equal to 2,the slopes of function to a is 2 times 2,is therefore equal to 4,and when a is equal to 5,then the slope of the function 2 times a is 2 times 5\n",
    "\n",
    "，为什么一个点的斜率，在不同位置会不同 如果你在曲线上的，不同位置画一些小小的三角形，你就会发现 三角形高和宽的比值，在曲线上不同的地方，它们是不同的，所以当a=2时，这里的斜率为4 而当a=5时，这里的斜率为10 如果你翻看，微积分的课本 课本会告诉你，d/da f(a) 这里f(a)等于a的平方，d/da f(a)的值，由课本上的公式可知，函数f(a)=a^2的斜率 应该等于2a，这里不证明这个公式，但你可以打开微积分课本，找到上面的公式表，它会告诉你f(a)=a^2的导数，确实为2a，事实上这也和我们 手工算的结果一样，当a=2时，函数的斜率为 2乘以2，即等于4，当a=5时 函数的斜率为，2乘以a 即2乘以5等于10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",is equal to 10 so if you ever pull up a calculus textbook,and you see this formula that,the derivative of a squared is equal to 2a,all that means is that for any given value of a,if you nudge it up with by 0.001,already your tiny little value,you would expect f of a to go up by 2a,that is the slope or the derivative times,however much you had an urge to the right,the value of a now one tiny little detail,you know I have used these approximate symbols here,and this wasn't exactly 4.04,there's an extra point 001,you know there it turns out that,this extra pont 001 this little thing here is,because we were nudging a to the right,by 0.001 if we're instead nudging it to the right,by this new infinitesimally small value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果你翻看微积分课本，你会看到这个公式，即a的平方的导数 等于2a，这意味着 任意给定一点a，如果你稍微将a，增大0.001，那么你会看到 f(a)将增大2a\n",
    "，即增大的值 为点在a处斜率或导数，乘以你向右移动的距离，现在 有个小细节需要注意，之前我在这里 使用了一些不精确的值，这里的值不应该为4.04，你知道这里，应该还有额外001 这里有额外的001 是因为，我们把a向右移动了0.001，然而 如果我们把a向右移动，像这样一个非常非常小的值\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "，那么这个额外的项\n",

    "\n",
    "，至于为什么不是 刚好等于4.004\n",
    ",and the reason why is not 4.004 exactly is\n",
    "\n",
    "，是因为导数就是根据\n",

    ",which is well and while 0.001 is small is not infinitesimally small\n",
    "\n",
    "，可以被忽略 这就是为什么\n",

    "\n",
    "，这个函数的导数应该为2a\n",
    ",will tell you that the derivative is equal to 2a\n",
    "\n",
    "，和之前的例子一样\n",
    ",and so the example we went through\n",
    "\n",
    "，如果a等于2 那么f(a)等于4\n",
    ",was that if a is equal to 2 f of a\n",
    "\n",
    "，把a向右边移动一点\n",
    ",equals 4 and if we nudge a\n",
    "\n",
    "，那么f(a)将增大一点 大约为4.004\n",
    ",so it's a little bit bigger then f of a is about 4.004\n",
    "\n",
    "，所以f(a)增大了向右移动距离的四倍\n",
    ",and so f of a went up four times as much\n",
    "\n",
    "，事实上 当a=2时\n",

    "\n",
    "，同样地 举一个例子\n",

    "\n",
    "，我们再次令a=2\n",
    ",let's take a equals 2 as an example again\n",
    "\n",
    "，a的三次方等于8\n",

    "\n",
    "，和8.012很接近\n",

    "\n",
    "，事实上 当a=2时\n",
    "and indeed when a is equal to 2\n",

    "，导数值为3 乘以2的平方\n",
    "that's 3. times 2 squared that's equal to 3 times\n",

    "，如果你将a向右移动 很小的一段距离\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",there's just two take-home messages from this video,first is that, the derivative of the function just means,the slope of a function and the slope of a function,can be different at different points on the function,in our first example where f of a equals 3a,this is a straight line the derivative was the same everywhere,it was 3 everywhere,but for other functions like f of a equals a squared,or f(a) equals log of a,the slope of the line varys,so the slope or the derivative can be different at different points on the curve,so does the first take away derivative just means slope of a line,second takeaway is that,if you want to look up the derivative of a function,you can flip open your calculus textbook or look at Wikipedia,you can flip open your calculus textbook or look at Wikipedia,and often get a formula,for the slope of these functions at different points,so that I hope you have an intuitive understanding of,derivatives or slopes of lines,let's go into the next video,we'll start to talk about the computation graph,and how to use that to compute derivatives of more complex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "，在这个视频中 你只需要记住两点，第一点是 函数的导数，就是函数的斜率，而函数的斜率 在不同的点是不同的，在第一个例子中f(a)=3a，这是一条直线 在任何点 它的斜率都是相同的，都是3，但是对于函数f(a)=a^2，或者f(a)=log(a)，它们的斜率是变化的，它们的导数或者斜率 在曲线上不同的点处，是不同的，这是第一个你需要记住的 即导数就是斜率，第二点是，如果你想知道 一个函数的导数，你可参考微积分课本或者维基百科，然后你应该就能，找到这些函数的导数公式，最后我希望 你对导数和斜率，有了一个直观的理解，接下来看下一个视频，下一课 我们将讲解流程图，以及如何用它 来求更加复杂的函数的导数\n",
