    "Probably say that the computations of a neural network,are all organized in terms of a forward path or a **forward propagation** step,in which we compute the output of the neural network followed by a backward pass or a back complication step,which we use to compute gradients or compute derivatives.the computation graph explains why it is organized this way,in this video we'll go through an example,in order to illustrate the computation graph.let's use a simpler example than logistic regression or a informal neural network.\n",

    "In the last video, we worked through an example of,using a computation graph to compute the function $J$.Now, let's take a cleaned up version,of that computation graph and show how you can use it,to figure out derivative calculations for that function $J$.So, here's a computation graph.Let's say you want to compute,the derivative of $J$ with respect to v. So, what is that?Well, this says if we were to,take this value of v and change it a little bit,how would the value of $J$ change?Well, $J$ is defined as three times v,and right now v is equal to 11.So, if we're to pump up v by a little bit to 11.001,then $J$ which has three vs and currently 33 will get pumped up to 33.003.So, here we've increased v by .001 and the net result of that is that $J$ goes up three times as much.So the derivative of $J$ with respect to v is equal to three,because the increase in $J$ is three times the increase in v.\n",
    "\n",
    "在上个视频中我们看了一个例子，使用流程图来计算函数$J$，现在我们清理一下，流程图的描述 看看你如何利用它，计算出函数$J$的导数，所以这是一个流程图，假设你要计算，$J$对$v$的导数 那怎么算呢?好 比如说 我们要，把这个v值拿过来 改变一下，那么$J$的值会怎么变呢?，所以定义上 $J$是$3v$，现在$v$等于 11，所以如果你让v增加一点点 比如到11.001，那么$J$是$3v$，现在 33 就增加到 33.003，所以我这里$v$增加了 0.001 然后，最终结果是$J$上升到原来的三倍，所以$J$对$v$的导数就等于 3，因为对于任何v的增量 $J$都会有三倍增量。\n",

    "and, in fact, this is very analogous to,the example we had in the previous video,where we had f(a) equals 3a.,and so, we then derive,that df(a)/da which was slightly simplified,and slightly sloppy notation,you can read as df/da was equal to three.So, instead, here we have $J$ equals 3v,and so $dJ/dv$ is equal to three,with here $J$ playing the role of f,and v playing the role of a in,this previous example that we had right from an earlier video.In the terminology of backpropagation what we've seen is that,if you want to compute,the derivative of this final output variable,which uses variable you care most about,with respect to v,then we're done sort of one step of backpropagation,so the called one step backwards in this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "而且这类似于，我们在上一个视频中的例子，我们有$f(a)=3a$，然后我们推导出，那个df(a)/da 就是稍微化简之后的，有点随便的写法，你可以看成$df/da=3$，所以这里我们有$J$=3v，所以$dJ/dv$就等于 3，这里$J$扮演了f的角色，$v$扮演了$a$的角色，在之前的视频里的例子，在反向传播算法中的术语 我们看到，如果你想计算，最后输出变量的导数，使用你最关心的变量，对$v$的导数，那么我们就做完了一步反向传播，在这个流程图中是一个反向步。\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at another example.What is $dJ/da$?In other words, if we pump up the value of a,how does that affect the value of $J$?Well, let's go through the example.variable a is equal to five.So let's pump it up to 5.001.The net impact of that is that v which was a plus U,so that was previous 11,this we can increase to 11.001.and then we've already seen as abovethat $J$ now gets bumped up to 33.003.So, what we've seen is that if you increase a by 0.001,$J$ increases by 0.003.and by increase a I mean if you were to take this value 5 and just plug in the new value,then the change to a will propagate to the right of the computation graph.So that $J$ ends up being 33.003.and so, the increase to $J$ is three times the increase to a.That means this derivative is equal to three.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们来看另一个例子，$dJ/da$是多少呢?换句话说 如果我们提高$a$的数值，对$J$的数值有什么影响?好 我们看看这个例子，变量$a=5$，我们让它增加到5.001，那么对$v$的影响就是$a+u$，之前是 11，现在变成 11.001，我们从上面看到，现在$J$就变成 33.003了，所以我们看到的是 如果你让 $a$ 增加 0.001，$J$增加 0.003，那么增加 $a$ 我是说，如果你把这个 5 换成某个新值，那么 $a$ 的改变量，就会传播到流程图的最右，所以$J$最后是 33.003，所以$J$的增量是 3 乘以 $a$ 的增量，意味着这个导数是 3。\n",

    "<center>![这里写图片描述](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20171227152155840?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvSlVOSlVOX1pIQU8=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to break this down is to say that if you change a then that would change v,and through changing v,that would change $J$.and so, the net change to the value of $J$,when you bump up the value,when you nudge the value of a up a little bit is that,first, by changing a you end up increasing v. Well,how much does v increase?It is increased by an amount that's determined by dv/da and then the change in v will cause the value of $J$ to also increase.So, in Calculus this is actually called the chain rule,that's if a affects v affects $J$,then the amount that $J$ changes when you nudge a is the product of how much v changes when you nudge a,times how much $J$ changes when you nudge v.So in Calculus again this is called the chain rule.What we saw from this calculation is that if you increase a by 0.001,v changes by the same amount.So dv/da is equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "要解释这个计算过程其中一种方式是，就是如果你改变了$a$那也会改变$v$，通过改变v，也会改变$J$，所以$J$值的净变化量，当你提升这个值，当你把$a$值提高一点点 这就是$J$的变化量，首先 $a$增加了 $v$也会增加，$v$增加多少呢?，增加了一个量，这取决于$dv/da$ 然后$v$的变化，导致$J$也在增加，所以这在微积分里实际上叫链式法则，如果$a$影响到$v$影响到$J$，那么当你让$a$变大时 $J$的变化量，就是当你改变$a$时$v$的变化量乘以，改变v时 $J$的变化量，在微积分里这叫链式法则，我们从这个计算中看到，如果你让$a$增加 0.001，$v$也会变化相同的大小，所以$dv/da$就等于1。\n",
    "\n",
    "So in fact if you plug in what we have worked up previously on d$J$/dv is equal to three and dv/da is equal to one,so the product of this, three times one.That actually gives you the correct value that $dJ/da$ is equal to three.This little illustration shows how by having computed $dJ/dv$ had this derivative with respect to this variable,it can then help you to compute $dJ/da$.and so, that's another step of this backward calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "事实上 如果你代入进去 我们之前算过，$\\dfrac{dJ}{dv }$ 等于 3，$\\dfrac{dv}{da}$等于 1，所以这个乘积 3×1，实际上就给出了正确答案， $\\dfrac{dJ}{da}$就等于 3，这张小图表示了 如何计算，$\\dfrac{dJ}{dv }$  就是这个对这个变量的导数，它可以帮你计算  $\\dfrac{dJ}{da}$，所以这是另一步反向传播计算。\n",

    "I just want to introduce one more new notational convention,which is that when you're writing codes to implement backpropagation,there usually be some final output variable that you really care about,a final output variable that you really care about or that you want to optimize.and in this case, this final output variable is j.It's really the last note in your computation graph.and so, a lot of computations will be trying to compute the derivative of that find the output variable.So d of this final output variable with respect to some other variable.Let me just call that, d var.\n",
    "\n",
    "现在我想介绍一个**新的符号约定**，当你编程实现反向传播时，通常会有一个最终输出值是你要关心的，最终的输出变量，你真正想要关心或者说优化的，在这种情况下 最终的输出变量是$J$，就是流程图里最后一个符号，所以有很多计算尝试，计算输出变量的导数，**所以$d$输出变量 对某个变量的导数，我们就用$dvar$命名。**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a lot of the computations you have would be to compute the derivative of the final output variable,letter $J$ in this case,with various intermediate variable such as a, b, c, u, v.and when you implement this in software,what do you call this variable name?One thing you could do is, in Python,you could write a very long variable name,d Final Output var over a d var.But that's a very long variable name.We could call this $dJ$, d var.But because you're always taking derivatives respect to $dJ$,respect to this final output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "所以在很多计算中你需要，计算最终输出结果的导数，在这个例子里是$J$，还有各种中间变量 比如a b c u v，当你在软件里实现的时候，变量名叫什么?，你可以做的一件事是 在 Python 中，你可以写一个很长的变量名，比如d FinalOutputvar 除以 d var，但这个变量名有点长，我们就用$dJ/dvar$，但因为你一直对$dJ$求导，对这个最终输出变量求导。\n",

    "I'm going to introduce a new notation, where in code,when you're computing this thing in the code you write,we're just going to use the variable name dvarin order to represent that quantity.Okay? So dvar in the code you write,will represent the derivative of the final output variable you care about such as j,sometimes the last L with respect to the various intermediate quantities you're computing in your code.So this thing here in your code,you use dv to denote this value.So dv would be equal to three and your code represents this as a da,which is we also figured out to be equal to three.Okay? So we've done backpropagation partiallythrough this computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "我这里要介绍一个新符号 在程序里，当你编程的时候 在代码里，我们就使用变量名$dvar$，来表示那个量，好 所以在程序里是$dvar$，表示导数，你关心的最终变量$J$的导数，有时最后是$L$，对代码中各种中间量的导数，所以代码里这个东西，你用$dv$表示这个值，所以$dv$就等于 3 你的代码表示就是$da$，这也等于 3，好 所以我们通过这个流程图，部分完成的后向传播算法。\n",

    "\n",
    "let's go through the rest of this example on the next slide.So let's go to clean up a copy of the computation graph.and just to recap,what we've done so far, is go backward here and figured out that dv is equal to three.and again, the definition of dv,that's just a variable name of the code is really d, j, d, v.I figured out that da is equal to three and again,da is the variable name in your code and that's really the value of dJ, da.

    "Well, through a similar calculation as what we did before,now we start off with u equals six.If you bump up u to 6.001,then v which is previous 11,goes up to 11.001,and so j goes from 33 to 33.003.and so the increase in j is 3x, so this is equal.and the analysis for u is very similar to the analysis we did for a.This is actually computed as dJ, dv times dv, du.With this, we had already figured out was three,and this turns out to be equal to one.So we've got one more step of back propagation,we end up computing that du is also equal to three,and du is of course, just as dJ, du.\n",
    "\n",
    "好 通过和之前类似的计算，现在我们从$u=6$出发。如果你令$u$增加到 6.001，那么$v$之前是 11，现在变成 11.001 了，$J$就从 33 变成 33.003。所以$J$增量是3倍 所以这就等于。你对$u$的分析很类似对$a$的分析。实际上这计算起来就是$\\dfrac{dJ}{dv}· \\dfrac{dv}{du}$。有了这个 我们就可以算那个结果是 3，这个结果是 1。所以我们还有一步反向传播，我们最终计算出$du$也等于 3，这$du$当然了 就是$dJ/du$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we just step through one last example in detail.So what is dJ, dv?Imagine if you are allowed to change the value of b and you want to tweak b a little bit in order to minimize or maximize the value of j.So what is the derivative, what's the slope of this function j when you change the value of b a little bit?It turns out that,using the chain rule for calculus,this can be written as the product of two things,is dJ, du times du, dv.and the reasoning is,if you change b a little bit, so b goes to 3 to, say, 3.001.The way it'll affect j is,it will first affect u.So how much does it affect u?\n",
    "\n",
    "现在我们仔细看看最后一个例子，$\\dfrac{dJ}{dv}$呢?想像一下 如果你改变了$b$的值 你想要，然后变化一点 让$J$值达到最大，那么导数是什么呢? 这个$J$函数的斜率，当你稍微改变$b$值之后，事实上，使用微积分的链式法则，这可以写成两者的乘积，就是 $\\dfrac{dJ}{du}·\\dfrac{du}{dv}$，理由是，如果你改变$b$一点点 所以$b$变成比如说 3.001，它影响$J$的方式是，首先会影响$u$，它对$u$的影响有多大?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, u is defined as b times c, right?So this will go from six when b is equal to three,to now, or 6.002.Right? Because c is equal to two, in our example here.and so this tells us that, du, db is equal to two,because when you pump up b by .001,u increase twice as much.So du, db, this is equal to two.and now, we know that u has gone up twice as much as b has gone up.Well, what is dJ, du?We've already figured out thatthis is equal to three and so by multiplying these two parts,we find that dJ,db is equal to six.\n",
    "\n",
    "好 $u$的定义是$b·c$，所以$b=3$时这是 6，现在就变成 6.002 了，对吧 因为在我们的例子中 $c$等于 2，所以这告诉我们$\\dfrac{du}{db}$等于 2，当你让$b$增加 0.001时，$u$就增加两倍，所以$\\dfrac{du}{db}$这等于 2，现在我想$u$已经增加量是$b$的两倍，那么$\\dfrac{dJ}{du}$是多少?，我们已经弄清楚了，这等于 3 所以让这两部分相乘，我们发现$\\dfrac{dJ}{db}$等于 6。\n",

    "\n",
    "and again, here's the reasoning for the second part of the argument, which is,we want to know when u goes up by .002,how does that affect j?The fact that dJ, du is equal to three,that tells us that when u goes up by .002,j goes up three times as much.So j should go up by .006, right?That comes from a fact that dJ, du is equal to three.and if you check the math in detail,you will find that,if b becomes 3.001,then u becomes 6.002,v becomes 11.002, so that's a plus u, that's five plus u.and then j, which is equal to three times v,that answer being equal to 33.006.Right? and so that's how you get that dJ, db is equal to six.and to fill that in, this is if we go backwards,so this is db is equal to six and db really is the Python code variable name for the dJ, db.and I won't go through the last example in great detail but it turns out that,if you also compute how dJ, da,this turns out to be dJ, du times du, da and this turns out to be nine.Just turns out to be three times three.I won't go through that example in detail.Through this last step,it is possible to derive that d_c is equal to 9.\n",

    "好这就是推导第二部分的推导 其中，我们想知道$u$增加 0.002，会对J有什么影响，实际上$\\dfrac{dJ}{du}$等于 3，这告诉我们$u$增加 0.002 之后，$j$上升了3 倍，那么$j$应该上升 0.006 对吧，这可以从$\\dfrac{dJ}{du}=3$推导出来，如果你仔细看看这些数学内容，你会发现，如果$b$变成 3.001，那么$u$就变成 6.002，$v$变成 11.002 所以这是$a+u$ 这是$5+u$，然后$j$就等于$3v$，所以答案就是 33.006，对吧? 这就是如何得到$\\dfrac{dJ}{db}=6$，为了填进去 如果我们反向走的话，这是$db$等于 6 而$db$其实是，Python 代码中的变量名 表示 $\\dfrac{dJ}{db}$，我不会很详细的介绍最后一个例子，但事实上，如果你同时算算 $\\dfrac{dJ}{da}$，结果这是$\\dfrac{dJ}{du}$，乘以 $\\dfrac{du}{da}$这结果是 9，是 3×3，我不会详细说明这个例子，在最后一步，我们可以推出$d_c$等于 9。\n",

    "So the key takeaway from this video,from this example is that,when computing derivatives in computing all of these derivatives,the most efficient way to do so,is through a right to left computation following the direction of the red arrows.and in particular, we'll first compute the derivatives respect to v,and then that becomes useful for computing the derivative respect a,and the derivative respect to u.and then, derivative respect to u, for example,this term over here and this term over here, those, in turn,become useful for computing the derivative respect to b,and the derivative respect to c. So that wasa computation graph and how there's a forward or left to right calculation to compute the cost functions such as j,do you might want to optimize.and a backwards or a right to left calculation to compute derivatives.\n",

    "所以这个视频的要点是，对于那个例子，当计算所有这些导数时，最有效率的办法是，从右到左计算，跟着这个红色箭头走，特别是 当我们第一次计算对 $v$的导数时，之后在计算对$a$导数就可以用到，对$u$的导数，然后对$u$的导数 比如说，这个项和这里这个项，可以帮助计算对$b$的导数，然后对$c$的导数 所以这是，一个计算流程图 就是正向，或者说从左到右的计算 来计算成本函数$j$，你可能需要优化的函数，然后反向从右到左计算导数。\n",
