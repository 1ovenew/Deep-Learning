    "So you're just about to reach the end of the first week,of material on the first course in this specialization. Let me give you a quick sense of,what you'll learn in the next few weeks as well. As I said in the first video ,this specialization comprises five courses. And right now, we're in the first of these five courses,which teach you the most important foundations ,really the most important building blocks of deep learning. So by the end of this first course ,you know how to build and get to work a deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "学习进度来到了这个“微专业”第一门课，第一周的最后，快速地介绍一下，下一周将要学习什么内容，在第一个视频里我已经说过，本“微专业”一共有五门课，目前是第一门课，在这门课中 将教会你最重要的基础知识，深度学习最重要的基础，第一门课的结尾，你将掌握 如何建立并运用一个深度神经网络，\n",
    "\n",
    "So here the details of what is in this first course.,This course is four weeks of material.,And you're just coming up to the end of the first week,when you saw an introduction to deep learning.,At the end of each week,,there are also be 10 multiple-choice questions that,you can use to double check your understanding of the material.,So when you're done watching this video,,I hope you're going to take a look at those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "下面是第一门课的一些细节，这门课有四个星期的学习材料，目前你就要完成第一周的学习了，学完了深度学习的入门介绍，在每一周的结尾，都会有十道多选题，可以用来检验自己对材料的理解，当你看完这个视频的时候，希望你能看看这些问题，\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second week, you then learn about,the Basics of Neural Network Programming.,You'll learn the structure of what we call,the forward propagation and the back propagation,steps of the algorithm,and how to implement neural networks efficiently.,Starting from the second week,,you also get to do a programming exercise,that lets you practice the material you've just learned,,implement the algorithms yourself and see it work for yourself.I find it really satisfying when I learn about algorithm,and they get it coded up and I see it worked for myself.,So I hope you enjoy that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "在第二周 你会学习到，神经网络的编程基础，了解神经网络中，“正向传播”和“反向传播”的结构，还有算法的过程，以及如何高效实现神经网络，从第二周开始，你也会开始做一些编程练习，练习学到的知识，自己实现算法 亲自调试到完美运行，当我学习算法的时候 那让我很过瘾，通过代码编程 亲自看到它完美运行，我希望你们也喜欢，\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learned the framework for neural network programming in the third week,,you code up a single hidden layer neural network. All right.,So you learn about all the key concepts needed to implement,and get to work in neural network.,And then finally in week four,,you build a deep neural network and neural network with many layers.,and see it worked for yourself.,So, congratulations on finishing the videos after this one.,I hope that you now have a good high-level sense,of what's happening in deep learning.,And perhaps some of you are also assigned to,\n",
    ",has some ideas of where you might want to,apply deep learning yourself.,So, I hope that after this video,,you go on to take a look at the 10 multiple choice questions,that follow this video on the course website,and just use the 10 multiple choice questions,to check your understanding.,And don't review, you don't get all the answers right the first time,,you can try again and again until you get them all right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "在学习了神经网络编程的框架之后 在第三周，你会编写单隐层神经网络，你需要学习所有必需的关键概念，才能实现神经网络，最后在第四周，你将建立了一个多层的深层神经网络，让它为你服务，恭喜你完成了这段视频，我希望你现在对深度学习，有一个高层次的理解，也许有些人会想，自己想到了，哪里可以应用深度学习，我希望看完这段视频后，你会去看那10个多项选择题，它们就在课程网站上，有10个多项选择题，来检查你的理解，不用复习  第一次做不知道所有答案，你可以多做几次 直到你把都做对了为止\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ",I found them useful to make sure,that I'm understanding all the concepts,,I hope you're that way too.,So with that, congrats again for getting up to here,and I look forward to seeing you in the week two videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "，我觉得这些问题很有用，能保证我理解了所有概念，我希望你也可以做到，说完了 再次祝贺你看到了这里，期待在第二周的视频中 也看到你\n",
