    "Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK.  从人脸图像中的表情判断一个人是否快乐。本文将基于Keras实现该功能。Keras是一个更高级的API，其底层框架可以是TensorFlow或者CNTK。\n",
    "2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using Keras? Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you can implement in TensorFlow but not (without more difficulty) in Keras. That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. \n",

    "## 2 - Building a model in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is very good for rapid prototyping. In just a short time you will be able to build a model that achieves outstanding results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a model in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "基于Keras我们可以快速实现我们的模型，以下是一个模型案例：\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model(input_shape):\n",
    "    # Define the input placeholder as a tensor with shape input_shape. Think of this as your input image!\n",
    "    X_input = Input(input_shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Zero-Padding: pads the border of X_input with zeroes\n",
    "    X = ZeroPadding2D((3, 3))(X_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # CONV -> BN -> RELU Block applied to X\n",
    "    X = Conv2D(32, (7, 7), strides = (1, 1), name = 'conv0')(X)\n",
    "    X = BatchNormalization(axis = 3, name = 'bn0')(X)\n",
    "    X = Activation('relu')(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # MAXPOOL\n",
    "    X = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='max_pool')(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # FLATTEN X (means convert it to a vector) + FULLYCONNECTED\n",
    "    X = Flatten()(X)\n",
    "    X = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='fc')(X)\n",

    "    return model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Keras uses a different convention with variable names than we've previously used with numpy and TensorFlow. In particular, rather than creating and assigning a new variable on each step of forward propagation such as `X`, `Z1`, `A1`, `Z2`, `A2`, etc. for the computations for the different layers, in Keras code each line above just reassigns `X` to a new value using `X = ...`. In other words, during each step of forward propagation, we are just writing the latest value in the commputation into the same variable `X`. The only exception was `X_input`, which we kept separate and did not overwrite, since we needed it at the end to create the Keras model instance (`model = Model(inputs = X_input, ...)` above). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Implement a `HappyModel()`. This assignment is more open-ended than most. We suggest that you start by implementing a model using the architecture we suggest, and run through the rest of this assignment using that as your initial model. But after that, come back and take initiative to try out other model architectures. For example, you might take inspiration from the model above, but then vary the network architecture and hyperparameters however you wish. You can also use other functions such as `AveragePooling2D()`, `GlobalMaxPooling2D()`, `Dropout()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You have to be careful with your data's shapes. Use what you've learned in the videos to make sure your convolutional, pooling and fully-connected layers are adapted to the volumes you're applying it to."
