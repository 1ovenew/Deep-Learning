    " In the last video you saw how very deep neural networks can have the problems of vanishing and exploding gradients. It turns out that a partial solution to this, doesn't solve it entirely, but helps a lot, is better or more careful choice of the random initialization for your neural network.To understand this, let's start with the example of initializing the weights for a single neuronand then we're going to generalize this to a deep network.Let's go through this with an example with just a single neuron and then we'll talk about the deep net later.So a single neuron you might input four features x1 through x4, and then you have some a=g(z) and end it up with some y, and later on for a deeper net you know these inputs will be right some layer a(l), but for now let's just call this x for now. So z is going to be equal to w1x1 + w2x2 +... + it goes WnXn and let's set b=0, so you know lets just ignore b for now. So in order to make z not blow up and not become too small, you notice that the larger n is, the smaller you want Wi to be, right? Because z is the sum of the WiXi, and so if you're adding up a lot of these terms, you want each of these terms to be smaller. One reasonable thing to do would be to set the variance of Wi to be equal to 1 over n,where n is the number of input features that's going into a neuron. So in practice, what you can do is set the weight matrix W for a certain layer to be np.random.randn you know, and then whatever the shape of the matrix is for this out here, and then times square root of one over the number of features that I fed into each neuron in layer l so it's going to be n of (l-1) because that's the number of units that I'm feeding(貌似是fitting) in to each of the units in layer l. It turns out that if you're using a Relu activation function that rather than 1 over n, it turns out that set in the variance that 2 over n works a little bit better. So you often see that in initialization, especially if you're using a Relu activation function, so if gl of (z) is ReLu of (z), oh, and it depends on how familiar you are with random variables. It turns out that something, a Gaussian random variable and then multiplying it by a square root of this, that says the variance to be quoted to this thing, to be to 2/n and the reason I went from n to this n superscript l-1 was, in this example with logistic regression which is unable to input features, but in more general case layer l would have n (l-1) inputs each of the units in that layer. So if the input features of activations are roughly mean 0 and standard variance and variance 1 then this would cause z to also take on a similar scale and this doesn't solve, but it definitely helps reduce the vanishing, exploding gradients problem because it's trying to set each of the weight matrices w you know so that it's not too much bigger than 1, and not too much less than 1, so it doesn't explode or vanish too quickly.I've just mention some other variants.The version we just described is assuming a Relu activation function, and this by a paper by Herd et al.. A few other variants, if you are using a TanH activation function, then there's a paper that shows that instead of using the constant 2,it's better use the constant 1,and so 1 over this, instead of 2, and so you multiply it by the square root of this. So this square root term will plays this term and you use this if you're using a TanH activation function. This is called Xavier initialization. And another version we're taught by Yoshua Bengio and his colleagues, you might see in some papers, but is to use this formula, which you know has some other theoretical justification, but I would say if you're using a Relu activation function, which is really the most common activation function, I would use this formula. If you're using TanH, you could try this version instead, and some authors will also use this, but in practice, I think all of these formulas just give you a starting point, it gives you a default value to use for the variance of the initialization of your weight matrices. If you wish the variance here, this variance parameter could be another thing that you could tune of your hyperparameters, so you could have another parameter that multiplies into this formula and tune that multiplier as part of your hyperparameter surge.Sometimes tuning the hyperparameter has a modest size effect. It's not one of the first hyperparameters I would usually try to tune, but I've also seen some problems with tuning this you know helps a reasonable amount, but this is usually lower down for me in terms of how important it is relative to the other hyperparameters you can tune. So I hope that gives you some intuition about the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients, as well as how choosing a reasonable scaling for how you initialize the weights. Hopefully that makes your weights, you know not explode too quickly and not decay to zero too quickly so you can train a reasonably deep network without the weights, or the gradients exploding or vanishing too much. When you train deep networks this is another trick that will help  you make your neural networks trained much more quickly.\n",

    " 上节课 我们学习了深度神经网络如何(字幕来源：网易云课堂)，产生梯度消失和梯度爆炸问题，最终 针对该问题 我们想出了一个不完整的解决方案 虽然不能彻底解决问题，却很有用，有助于我们为神经网络更谨慎地选择随机初始化参数，为了更好地理解它，我们先举一个神经单元权重初始化的例子 然后再演变到整个深度网络，我们来看看只有一个神经元的情况，然后才是深度网络，单个神经元可能有4个输入特征 从X1到X4，经过a=g(z)处理 最终得到ŷ，稍后讲深度网络时 这些输入表示为a[l]，暂时我们用x表示，z=w1x1+ w2x2+………….+ wnxn，b=0 暂时忽略b，为了预防z值过大或过小，你可以看到 n越大，你希望Wi越小，因为z是WiXi的和，如果你把很多此类项相加 希望每项值更小，最合理的方法就是设置Wi=1/n， n表示神经元的输入特征数量，实际上 你要做的就是设置某层权重矩阵W，等于np.random.randn，这里是矩阵的shape函数，再乘以，该层每个神经元的特征数量分之一，即1/n[l-1]，这就是l层上拟合的单元数量，结果 如果你用的是Relu激活函数 而不是1/n，方差设置为2/n 效果会更好，你尝尝发现 初始化时 尤其是使用Relu激活函数时，g[l](z)=Relu(z)，它取决于你对随机变量的熟悉程度，这是高斯随机变量， 然后乘以它的平方根，也就是引用这个方差2/n，这里 我用的是n[l-11] 因为，本例中 逻辑回归的特征是不变的，但一般情况下，l层上的每个神经元都有n(l-1)个输入，如果激活函数的输入特征被零均值 标准方差 方差是1，z也会调整到相似范围，这就没解决问题，但它确实降低了坡度消失和爆炸问题，因为它给权重矩阵W设置了合理值，你也知道  它不能比1大很多 也不能比1小很多，所以梯度没有爆炸或消失过快，我提到了其它变体函数，刚刚提到的函数是Relu激活函数，一篇由Herd等人撰写的论文曾介绍过，对于几个其它变体函数，如Tanh激活函数，有篇论文提到，常量1比常量2的效率更高，对于tanh函数来说  它是1/n^([l-1])的平方根，这里平方根的作用与这个公式作用相同，它适用于Tanh激活函数，被称为Xavier初始化，Yoshua Bengio和他的同事还提出另一种方法，你可能在一些论文中看到过，他们使用的是公式2/(n^[l-1]+n^[l] )的平方根，其它理论已对此证明，但如果你想用Relu激活函数，也就是最常用的激活函数，我会用这个公式np.sqrt(2/n^[l-1] )，如果使用TanH函数 可以用公式√(1/n^([l-1]) )，有些作者也会使用这个函数，实际上 我认为所有这些公式只是给你一个起点，它们给出初始化权重矩阵的方差的默认值，如果你想添加方差，方差参数则是另一个你需要调整的超级参数，可以给公式np.sqrt(2/n^[l-1] )添加一个乘数参数，调优作为超级参数激增一份子的乘子参数，有时调优该超级参数效果一般，这并不是我想调优的首要超级参数，但我已经发现调优过程中产生的问题，虽然调优该参数能起到一定作用，但考虑到相比调优其它超级参数的重要性，我通常把它的优先级放得比较低，希望现在你对梯度消失或爆炸问题，以及如何为权重矩阵初始化合理值已经有了一个直观认识，希望你设置的权重矩阵 既不会增长过快 也不会太快下降到0，从而训练出一个，权重或梯度不会增长或消失过快的深度网络，我们在训练深度网络时，这也是一个加快训练速度的技巧，"
