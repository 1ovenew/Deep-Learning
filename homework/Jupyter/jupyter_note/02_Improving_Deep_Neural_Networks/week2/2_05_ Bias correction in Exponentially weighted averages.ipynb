    "2.5 Bias correction in Exponentially weighted averages  (指数加权平均的偏差修正) \n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned how to implement exponentially weighted averages.There's one technical detail called bias correctionthat can make you computation of these averages more accurately.Let's see how that works.In a previous video, you saw this figure for beta = 0.9.This figure for beta = 0.98.But it turns out that if you implement the formula as written here,you won't actually get the green curve when, say, beta = 0.98.You actually get the purple curve here.And you notice that the purple curve starts off really low.So let's see how to fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "你学过了如何计算指数加权平均数(字幕来源：网易云课堂)，有一个技术名词 叫做偏差修正，可以让平均数运算更加准确，来看看它是怎么运作的，在上个视频中 这个曲线对应β的值为0.9，这个曲线对应的β = 0.98，如果你执行写在这里的公式，在β等于0.98的时候 得到的并不是绿色曲线，而是紫色曲线，你可以注意到紫色曲线的起点较低，我们来看看怎么处理，计算移动平均数的时候，初始化v_0 = 0，v_1 = 0.98 * v_0 + 0.02乘以1号数据，但是v_0 = 0 所以这部分没有了，所以v_1等于0.02乘以1号数据，\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're implementing a moving average,you initialize it with v_0 = 0,and then v1 = 0.98 V0 + 0.02 data 1.But V0 is equal to 0 so that term just goes away.So V1 is just 0.02 times data 1.So that's why if the first day's temperature is, say 40 degrees Fahrenheit,then v_1 will be 0.02 times 40, which is 8.So you get a much lower value down here.So it's not a very good estimate of the first day's temperature.v_2 will be 0.98 times v_1 + 0.02 times data 2.And if you plug in v1, which is this down here and multiply it out,then you find that v2 is actually equal to 0.98 times 0.02 times data 1plus 0.02 times data 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "所以如果第一天温度是40华氏度，那么v_1就是0.02乘以40 也就是8，因此得到的值会小很多，所以第一天温度的估测不准，v_2等于0.98乘以v_1加上0.02乘以2号数据，如果代入v_1 然后相乘，所以v_2 = 0.98*0.02乘以1号数据，加上0.02乘上2号数据，也就是0.0196乘以1号数据加上0.02乘上2号数据，假设1号和2号数据都是正数，计算后 v_2要远小于1号和2号数据，所以v_2不能很好估测出这一年前两天的温度，有个办法可以修改这一估测，让估测变得更好 更准确，特别是在估测初期，也就是不用v_t 而是用v_t除以(1-β^t)，t就是现在的天数，\n",
    "\n",
    "And that 0.0 196 data1 + 0.02 data2.So again, assuming data1 and data2 are positive numbers,when you compute this v_2 will be much less than data1 or data2.So v2 isn't a very good estimate of the first two days' temperature of the year.So it turns out that there is a way to modify this estimatethat makes it much better, that makes it more accurate,especially during this initial phase of your estimate.Which is that, instead of taking v_t, take v_t divided by 1-Beta to the power of twhere t is the current day you're on.So let's take a concrete example.When t = 2, 1- beta to the power of t is1- 0.98 squaredand it urns out that this is 0.0396.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "举个具体例子，当t = 2时 1-β^t，也就是1-0.98^2，答案是0.0396，因此对第二天温度的估测，变成了v_2除以0.0396，也就是0.0196乘以1号数据加上0.02乘以2号数据，然后二者相加 分母为0.0396，这也就是1号和2号数据的加权平均数，并去除了偏差，你会发现随着t增加，β的t次方将接近于0，所以当t很大的时候，偏差修正几乎没有作用，因此当t较大的时候，紫线基本和绿线重合了，\n",
    "\n",
    "And so your estimate of the temperature on day 2becomes v_2 divided by 0.0396 andthis is going to be 0.0196 times data 1 + 0.02 data 2.You notice that these two things adds up to the denominator 0.0396.And so this becomes a weighted average of data 1 and data 2,and this removes this bias.So you notice that as t becomes large,beta to the t will approach 0which is why when t is large enough,the bias correction makes almost no difference.This is why when t is large,the purple line and the green, line they are much over that.But during this initial phase of learningwhen you're still warming up your estimateswhen the bias correction can help you to obtain a better estimate of this temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is this bias correction that helps yougo from the purple line to the green line.So in machine learning,for most implementations of the exponential weighted average,people don't often bother to implement bias corrections.Because most people would rather just wait that initial period andhave a slightly more biased estimate and go from there.But if you are concerned about the bias during this initial phase,while your exponentially weighted moving average is still warming up.Then bias correction can help you get a better estimate early on.So you now know how to implement exponentially weighted moving averages.Let's go on and use this to build some better optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "不过在开始学习阶段，你才开始预测热身练习，偏差修正可以帮助你更好预测温度，偏差修正可以帮助你，使结果从紫线变成绿线，在机器学习中，在计算指数加权平均数的大部分时候，大家不在乎执行偏差修正，因为大部分人宁愿熬过初始时期，拿到具有偏差的估测 然后继续计算下去，如果你关心初始时期的偏差，在刚开始计算指数加权移动平均数的时候，偏差修正能帮助你在早期获得更好的估测，所以你学会了计算指数加权移动平均数，我们接着就用它来构建更好的优化算法吧！，\n",
